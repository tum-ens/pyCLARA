"""
This script takes a shape file of transmission network and uses the graph theory to identify the islands.
After the identification of islands, it makes connections between those islands.
To run this script, specify the name of the transmission shape file in the trans_file variable.
Output will be a shapefile called "trans_connected.shp".
Sample command to run the script: python connecting_transmission_islands.py

Packages required are as follows:
1. networkx
2. pandas
3. geopandas
4. numpy
5. shapely
6. scipy
